### Description
There are 2 exercises, with 2 parts to each, and you will typically need 2 different thickness bands
Start by wrapping the band on the cross bar at shoulder height.
The first part of the exercise is a forward rolling circle while facing away from the bar - i.e. it's behind you. Your arm should be straight out sideways from your body, with the band straight behind you - so almost an L shape from your body to the cross bar. The band should be under tension, and enough tension that you can still feel it when you move your hand to the closest part to the bar of the exercise
Move your hand in a circle, while keeping your elbows locked. The size and speed of the circular movements should be varied workout to workout, but will vary between basketball and hula hoop size circles. Keep the movement smooth and circular, don't jerk it forwards and backwards. 
Do 10 forward, then 10 back.
Repeat the other arm

The second exercise is the exact reverse. You will need to use a lighter band for this exercise. 
Even more so with this version, go slowly and move through the entire circle, keeping your hands from accelerating through different parts of the movement.
Again, 10 forward circles, then 10 back

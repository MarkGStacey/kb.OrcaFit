### Description
Stand with your left foot on the band, and holding it with your right hand over your left hip, with a slightly bent elbow. Extend your right arm across your body and extend the elbow at the same time - til your arm is at 45 degrees above your head with the band at full tension. Let the band come back slowly - a lot of the benefit from this comes from the slow release rather than the initial movement
Repeat the other side

### Description
**The next exercise is the side-lying external rotation movement.**

The movement specifically targets the two posterior rotator cuff muscles at once; the infraspinatus and the teres minor.

This exercise is your best bet at targetting these rotator cuff muscles, as shown in the following two EMG graphs from a  [2004 analysis](https://www.jospt.org/doi/abs/10.2519/jospt.2004.34.7.385)  of the rotator cuff muscles.

Side-lying external rotations elicit the highest infraspinatus and teres minor activation when compared to several other rotator cuff exercises. Furthermore, these external rotations cause the lowest strain on the shoulder joint.

As with any exercise, and especially rotator cuff exercises, to reap the full benefits, it’s vital that you perform this movement correctly.

**To begin, assume a side-lying position with a towel roll pinned between your top side arm and rib cage.**

The towel is an important step since  [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15296366)  has shown that adding a towel roll to the exercise boosts EMG activation of the 2 posterior rotator cuff muscles by roughly 20%. The purpose of using a towel is to minimize movement compensations from occurring.
## **To Perform This Exercise:**

-   Pull your shoulder blades back and down and keep them locked in this position as you proceed with your set.
-   Keep your shoulder blades back and down throughout the entire set.
-   Start with your arms parallel to the floor and then slowly externally rotate outwards by pulling your hand up towards the ceiling, and then return back down to parallel and repeat.

You’ll want to avoid letting your elbow drift up off your side as you raise the weight, as this will start involving more of the deltoids.

Instead, keep the elbow locked in place against the towel at your side as you perform each rep.

If you find it difficult to perform this movement or you feel pain at the top position, then you can start with partial reps. Perform partial reps in the ‘pain-free zone’ and progressively increase your range of motion over time.

I recommend starting out with a lighter weight for 2-3  [sets](https://builtwithscience.com/how-many-sets-should-i-do/)  of 15-20 reps each side, and then progressing from there as you get stronger. You can also perform this exercise with no weight at all.
